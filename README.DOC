GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

MT3DMS is a new version of MT3D developed at the University of Alabama
for the US Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station.
Detailed information on MT3DMS can be found in MT3DMS Documentation
and User's Guide (Zheng and Wang, 1998), available at
http://hydro.geo.ua.edu.  To report any program errors, please contact,

EXECUTABLE PROGRAM AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
==========================================

The executable program, MT3DMS.EXE, was compiled with the Lahey
LF90 FORTRAN 90 compiler Version 4.00 to run on PCs with a 80486
or higher CPU to run in 32-bit protected mode using extended memory.
The main program, main350.for, contains FORTRAN 90 extensions
to allow dynamic array allocation.  The compiled program will
allocate the exact amount of memory that is required for a
particular problem at run-time.  If the memory required by the
problem exceeds the total amount of physical memory that is
available, MT3DMS.EXE will print out a message "NOT ENOUGH MEMORY"
and then aborts.  MT3DMS.EXE runs under Microsoft DOS or Windows
v3.x/9x/NT in the DOS compatibility box.


INSTALLATION AND SETUP
======================

To install for the first time, create a subdirectory
with a name such as MT3DMS and then copy files MT3DMS.EXE
and LF90.EER to the new subdirectory.  Make sure to modify your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file to place the MT3DMS subdirectory in the PATH
statement.  File LF90.EER contains the Lahey compiler's run-time
error messages.  When a run-time error occurs, MT3DMS.EXE will
first search the current working directory and then all directories
specified in the PATH statement to locate file LF90.EER before
it can print out the error message.

To re-compile MT3DMS with Lahey LF90 compiler Version 4.00 or later,
copy all source files to a temporary subdirectory and type 'AM'
to start the AUTOMAKE utility included with the compiler.

Except for a few FORTRAN 90 extensions, MT3DMS was written in standard
ANSI FORTRAN 77 language and thus can be compiled by most FORTRAN 77
compilers including Lahey F77L3.


INTERFACE WITH MODFLOW
======================

Two versions of USGS MODFLOW with the Link-MT3D interface are
included with the MT3DMS distribution files: MODFLOW3.ZIP for
the original MODFLOW-88 and MODFLW96.ZIP for the more recent
MODFLOW-96.

The Link-MT3D interface for MODFLOW-88 is implemented as an add-on
package (referred to as the LKMT package) and consists of two files,
LKMT3.INC and LKMT3.FOR where 3 denotes version 3).

The file LKMT3.INC is a FORTRAN `include' file which contains
FORTRAN statements to invoke the LKMT3 package.  It should
be added to the MODFLOW main program immediately before the
call to the module `BAS1OT'.  This is done by adding an
`include' statement as shown below:

--------------------------
C
C--SAVE UNFORMATTED FLOW-TRANSPORT LINK FILE FOR USE BY MT3DMS
      INCLUDE 'LKMT3.INC'
C
C--PRINT AND OR SAVE HEADS AND DRAWDOWNS. PRINT OVERALL BUDGET.
      CALL BAS1OT(...)
C
--------------------------

The file LKMT3.FOR is the FORTRAN source file for the LKMT3
Package.  It must be compiled and linked with other packages
for MODFLOW.

The Link-MT3D interface for MODFLOW-96 is implemented in a
similar fashion.  Refer to the README file included with
MODFLOW-96 files.
