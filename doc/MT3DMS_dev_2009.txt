Recent Developments and Future Directions for
MT3DMS and Related Transport Codes
reviewed by Chunmiao Zheng

Introduction
MT3DMS is a three-dimensional (3D) multispecies
contaminant transport model with a modular structure to
permit simulation of solute transport processes independently or jointly (Zheng and Wang 1999; Zheng 2009).
MT3DMS interfaces directly with the U.S. Geological Survey’s ﬁnite-difference ground water ﬂow model,
MODFLOW, for the ﬂow solution, and supports all
the hydrologic and discretization features of MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh 1988; Harbaugh et al.
2000; Harbaugh 2005). MT3DMS is unique in that it
contains several transport solution techniques in a single code, including the fully implicit ﬁnite-difference
method (FDM), the particle-tracking based method of
characteristics (MOC) and its variants, and a third-order
total-variation-diminishing (TVD) scheme that conserves
mass while limiting numerical dispersion and artiﬁcial
oscillation.
Since its ﬁrst release in 1990 as MT3D for singlespecies mass transport (Zheng 1990), MT3DMS has been
widely used in research projects and practical ﬁeld applications. In recent years, continuing development efforts
have signiﬁcantly expanded the simulation capabilities of
MT3DMS through new extensions and related codes. This
column provides a brief overview of the recent developments and future directions in the MT3DMS family of
transport-modeling tools.

Recent Developments
Coupled Geochemical and Transport Modeling
By itself, MT3DMS is primarily intended to simulate
physical transport processes, that is, advection, dispersion, molecular diffusion, and various ﬂuid sinks/sources.

Although it contains basic functionalities for modeling
sorption and simple kinetic reactions, an add-on reaction
module must be incorporated into MT3DMS for multispecies reactive transport modeling. A number of reactive
modules have been developed for this purpose, including
MT3D’99 (Zheng 1999), RT3D (Clement 1997, 2003),
and SEAM3D (Waddill and Widdowson 1998; Widdowson 2002), among others. MT3D’99 is a special version of
MT3DMS implemented with biodegradation kinetics and
parent-daughter chair reactions. RT3D couples MT3DMS
with several preprogrammed reaction modules for common biologically mediated reactions. In addition, the user
has the option to program any arbitrary kinetic reactions.
SEAM3D is similar to RT3D in concept but is more
speciﬁcally focused on sequential electron acceptor-based
biological reactions.
The most comprehensive tool in this category is
the PHT3D code (Prommer et al. 2003), which couples MT3DMS with the geochemical modeling program PHREEQC-2 (Parkhurst and Appelo 1999) for
simulation of complex multicomponent reactive transport
processes. Most of the geochemical modeling capabilities of PHREEQC-2 are retained in PHT3D, including
equilibrium-controlled aqueous complexation/speciation,
kinetic reactions of aqueous components such as biodegradation of organic compounds, mineral precipitation/
dissolution, ion exchange, and surface complexation reactions. Recent applications of PHT3D to complex ﬁeldscale reactive transport systems include water-quality
changes during managed aquifer recharge (Prommer and
Stuyfzand 2005; Greskowiak et al. 2006), fate of oxidisable organic contaminants in ground water (Barry et al.
2002), isotopic fractionation processes (Van Breukelen
and Prommer 2008), and impact of mass transfer processes on uranium fate (Ma et al. unpublished data).
Figure 1 shows the results of a modeling study that investigated microbial dynamics and geochemical changes in a
metal bioprecipitation experiment (Prommer et al. 2007).
Variable-Density Flow and Transport Modeling
The use of MT3DMS with MODFLOW is based on
the “decoupled” approach that allows ﬂow and transport

simulations to be completed independently of each other
for greater computational efﬁciency. The intrinsic assumption is that solute concentrations are sufﬁciently small
so that their effect on ﬂuid density is negligible. While
this assumption is valid in many contaminant transportmodeling applications, it is not in situations where there
is substantial variation in ﬂuid density, such as sea water
intrusion or brine transport.
An area that has seen rapid development in recent
years is variable-density ﬂow and transport modeling
through the SEAWAT series of codes (Guo and Bennett 1998; Guo and Langevin 2002; Langevin et al.
2007). SEAWAT combines MODFLOW and MT3DMS
into a single code for ﬂow and transport modeling under
variable-density and variable-viscosity conditions. In the
coupled approach, the ﬂow solution is initially obtained
and then passed to the transport solver for the concentration solution. The concentration solution is next used
by the ﬂow solver to update the ﬂuid density and obtain
NGWA.org

the new ﬂow solution. This iterative process continues
until the end of the simulation period is reached. SEAWAT has found many real-world applications in sea water
intrusion and other density-dependent ﬂow and transport
problems (e.g., Langevin 2001; Langevin and Guo 2006;
Bauer-Gottwein et al. 2007; Post and Prommer 2007;
Lin et al. 2009).
Direct Ground Water Age Simulation
Goode (1996) derived the governing equation for
modeling ground water ages (or mean resident times),
which in the simplest form can be written as:
∂A
∂
=
∂t
∂xi

Dij

∂A
∂xj

−

∂
(ν i A) + 1
∂xi

(1)

where A represents the age of an ideal tracer through the
ground water ﬂow system, Dij is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor, and vi is the seepage velocity. Equation 1
is mathematically equivalent to the solute transport

equation solved by MT3DMS,
∂
∂C
=
∂t
∂xi

Dij

∂C
∂xj

−

∂
(ν i C) − γ
∂xi

(2)

where C is the solute concentration, and γ is the zerothorder decay term. The zeroth-order decay term has been
added to MT3DMS since version 5.2 released in 2006.
Because of the mathematical equivalency between
Equations 1 and 2, MT3DMS can be used to simulate the ground water age distribution directly by setting the zeroth-order decay constant to −1, that is, a
unit production, and by setting appropriate initial and
boundary conditions. In so doing, the values of concentration calculated by MT3DMS represent the mean
ground water ages or resident times. The ages computed through Equations 1 or 2 account for advection
as well as hydrodynamic mixing of waters of different
ages, and thus are more representative of the actual ages
in the aquifer than those computed by particle tracking,
which considers advective transport only. The age simulation capability of MT3DMS has been applied to some
ﬁeld problems (e.g., Zheng 2007; Konikow et al. 2008).
It is expected that more applications will follow in the
future as ground water age data become more widely
available.
Modeling Heat as a Ground Water Tracer
Heat is increasingly being recognized as an excellent
ground water tracer because of its usefulness in identifying multiple hydrologic processes and recent availability
of improved temperature sensors and measurement technologies (Anderson 2005). The mathematical equivalency
between the heat and solute transport equations has been
established in numerous studies (e.g., Healy and Ronan
1996; Kim et al. 2005; Prommer and Stuyfzand 2005;
Greskowiak et al. 2006; Thorne et al. 2006; Bayer et al.

2008). As a result, MT3DMS can be used directly and
efﬁciently to simulate heat transport with simple variable
conversion. Figure 2 shows a heat plume from injection
of cool water into warmer ground water as part of a premodeling exercise to guide the subsequent actual ﬁeld
heat tracer test.
The use of MT3DMS for heat transport modeling
is based on the assumption that the changes in ﬂuid
density and viscosity induced by temperature variation
are negligible so that ﬂow and transport simulations
can be decoupled for greater computational efﬁciency.
However, when temperature causes signiﬁcant changes
in ﬂuid density and viscosity, the SEAWAT code is more
suitable because it can account for the effects of variable
ﬂuid density and viscosity during heat transport. Ma and
Zheng (unpublished data) conducted a series of numerical
experiments to quantify the conditions under which the
effects of variable density and viscosity can be neglected
without any signiﬁcant loss of computational accuracy.

Future Directions
Transport in Unsaturated Zones
MT3DMS has already been linked with the hydrocarbon spill screening model (HSSM) (Weaver 1996) as
part of its extension to the unsaturated zone. HSSM is
a computer code that simulates the vertical migration of
a light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) contaminant
through the unsaturated zone and the formation of an
oil lens on the water table. It also determines the rate
of contaminant mass ﬂux dissolved from the LNAPL
source into ground water. Through a new time-varying
source package (Zheng et al. 2009), the effect of one or
more such LNAPL sources can be incorporated into threedimensional (3D) advective-dispersive-reactive transport
simulation using MT3DMS.

Hanford 300A site in Washington State.

New work is going on to link MT3DMS and related
codes directly with an unsaturated ﬂow package for
MODFLOW such as the unsaturated-zone ﬂow (UZF)
package (Niswonger et al. 2006) or the variably saturated
ﬂow (VSF) process (Thoms et al. 2006). The UZF Package simulates vertical one-dimensional (1D) unsaturated
ﬂow using the computationally efﬁcient kinematic wave
approximation, while the VSF process solves a fully 3D
Richards’ equation for unsaturated ﬂow above the water
table. The soil moisture contents and ﬂuxes solved by
UZF or VSF will be saved for use by MT3DMS to
simulate the solute transport and reactions through the
unsaturated zone.
Integrated Surface and Ground Water Modeling
Another area expected to have signiﬁcant development activities is a closer integration with surface water
modeling tools. This will build transport-modeling support in MT3DMS and related codes for newly developed
or enhanced surface water packages such as stream routing and lakes. In addition, new ﬂow processes for MODFLOW such as the farm process (Schmid et al. 2006)
and conduit ﬂow process (Shoemaker et al. 2007) can
be supported to address water-quality issues during agriculture irrigation and ground water–conduit interaction.
An example of the linkage between MT3DMS and a
predecessor to the conduit ﬂow process was described
by Spiessl et al. (2007).
The long-term vision is to make MT3DMS a solute
transport solver in fully integrated surface water–ground
water modeling systems such as GSFLOW (Markstrom
et al. 2008). This can only be accomplished through close
collaboration and coordination between MT3DMS authors
and other model developers, including those in the U.S.
Geological Survey.
Solving Nonideal Transport Processes
MT3DMS is originally based on the classical
advection-dispersion formulation for modeling solute
transport through porous media. Since 1999, it has supported the dual-domain mass transfer formulation to
accommodate preferential transport along highconductivity pathways and mass exchange between the
preferential transport pathways and less permeable matrix
(Zheng and Wang 1999; Feehley et al. 2000). In recent
years, more conceptual and mathematical model formulations have been developed for simulating solute transport
in highly heterogeneous aquifers, including dual-domain
multirate mass transfer (e.g., Haggerty and Gorelick
1995), fractional-order advection-dispersion (e.g., Benson
et al. 2000), and continuous-time random walk (e.g.,
Berkowitz et al. 2002). One or more of these formulations will be implemented in MT3DMS to provide a wider
selection of conceptual models to describe nonideal transport processes under complex ﬁeld conditions.

Summary
MT3DMS and its predecessor MT3D were developed as the transport companion to the U.S. Geological
NGWA.org

Survey’s ground water ﬂow model, MODFLOW. Since
the 1990s, MT3D and MT3DMS have been widely used
in research projects and practical ﬁeld applications. In
addition to solute transport, the MT3DMS code has also
been applied to simulate ground water age distribution and
heat transport. Continuing development efforts in recent
years have signiﬁcantly expanded the simulation capabilities of MT3DMS through new extensions and related
modeling tools, especially in the areas of reactive transport, variable-density ﬂow and transport, ground water
age, and heat transport.
Future developments of MT3DMS and related codes
will focus on extension to the unsaturated zone, a closer
integration with surface water modeling components,
and implementation of new conceptual and mathematical model formulations. Other related activities to make
transport modeling more efﬁcient and accurate will continue, including parameter estimation (e.g., Mehl and
Hill 2001; Doherty 2004; Poeter et al. 2005), management optimization (e.g., Zheng and Wang 2002), local
grid reﬁnement (e.g., Mehl and Hill 2005), and parallelization to take full advantage of modern computer
architecture.
