INTRODUCTION
After MT3DMS is installed on your hard drive, a folder named [examples] is
created which contains the input and output files for all 10 benchmark test
problems described in the MT3DMS User’s Manuals (Zheng and Wang, 1999, p. 130163) as well as additional examples described MT3DMS v5.x Supplemental User’s
Guide (Zheng, 2010). Further under [examples] are three folders named
[mf96mt3d], [mf2kmt3d], [mf2005mt3d], i.e.,
--examples
|
|--mf96mt3d
|
|--mf2kmt3d
|
|--mf2005mt3d
The first folder [mf96mt3d] contains the MT3DMS transport files along with the
flow files prepared for MODFLOW-96. The second subdirectory [mf2kmt3d] and
third subdirectory [mf2005mt3d] contain additional MT3DMS transport examples
along with the flow files prepared for MODFLOW-2000 and MODFLOW-2005,
respectively.

RUNNING MT3DMS WITH MODFLOW-96
To run any test problem under [mf96mt3d], first go to the folders P01, P02, …,
or P10. For each example, there are a NAME file for MODFLOW-96 called p1mf.nam,
p2mf.nam, …, or p10mf.nam, and a NAME file for MT3DMS called p1mt.nam, p2mt.nam,
…, or p10mt.nam. These NAME files specify the input/output files required by
MODFLOW-96 and MT3DMS v5.
To start a MODFLOW-96 run, enter a command as follows in command prompt mode
under Microsoft Windows:
C:\MT3DMS5\Bin\mf96

p1mf.nam

where “mf96” is the name of the executable code for the version of MODFLOW-96
with Link-MT3DMS interface, and [C:\MT3DMS5\Bin] is the subdirectory where the
MT3DMS and MODFLOW executables are located. If the folder name has already been
added to the command prompt configuration file AUTOEXEC.bat or the Windows PATH
environment variable, enter the command simply as

mf96

p1mf.nam

After each MODFLOW-96 run is completed, a flow-transport link file with a name
such as p1.ftl, p1.ftl, …, or p10.ftl is created which contains the flow model
information required by the transport model.
To start a MT3DMS run after the flow solution is obtained by MODFLOW-96, enter
the command as
C:\MT3DMS5\Bin\mt3dms5s

p1mt.nam

or simply
mt3dms5s

p1mt.nam

where [mt3dms5s] is the name of the executable code for the standard version of
MT3DMS v5 that requires the flow-transport link file to be in the style of
structured, unformatted files generated by Lahey Fortran 95 (LF95) or Compaq/HP
Visual Fortran (VF).

RUNNING MT3DMS WITH MODFLOW-2000
To run any test problems under [mf2kmt3d], first go to the folder for a
particular example. To start a MODFLOW-2000 run, enter a command as follows in
command prompt mode under Microsoft Windows:
C:\MT3DMS5\Bin\mf2k

p7mf2k.nam

where “mf2k” is the name of the executable code for MODFLOW-2000 version 1.17 or
later with Link-MT3DMS Package 6.3 or later, and [C:\MT3DMS5\Bin] is the folder
where MT3DMS and MODFLOW executables are located. If the folder name has already
been added to the command prompt configuration file AUTOEXEC.bat or the Windows
PATH environment variable, enter the command simply as
mf2k

p7mf2k.nam

Note that if a newer version of MODFLOW-2000 is installed on your PC, you can
replace the file “mf2k.exe” under C:\MT3DMS5\Bin with the newer version, or use
the newer version by specifying the PATH of the newer executable code.
After a MODFLOW-2000 run is completed, a flow-transport link file with a name
such as p7.ftl is created which contains the flow model information required by
the transport model.
To start a MT3DMS run after the flow solution is obtained by MODFLOW-2000, enter
the command as
C:\MT3DMS5\Bin\mt3dms5b

p7mt.nam

or simply
mt3dms5b

p7mt.nam

where [mt3dms5b] is the name of the executable code for a version of MT3DMS v5
that requires the flow-transport link file to be in the style of unstructured,

true binary files that are based on a non-standard Fortran feature but are more
transportable among different Fortran compilers.

RUNNING MT3DMS WITH MODFLOW-2005
To run any test problems under [mf2005mt3d], first go to the folder for a
particular example. To start a MODFLOW-2005 run, enter a command as follows in
command prompt mode under Microsoft Windows:
C:\MT3DMS5\Bin\mf2005

p7mf2005.nam

where “mf2005” is the name of the executable code for MODFLOW-2005 version 1.8
or later with Link-MT3DMS Package 7 or later, and [C:\MT3DMS5\Bin] is the folder
where MT3DMS and MODFLOW executables are located. If the folder name has already
been added to the command prompt configuration file AUTOEXEC.bat or the Windows
PATH environment variable, enter the command simply as
mf2005

p7mf2005.nam

Note that if a newer version of MODFLOW-2005 is installed on your PC, you can
replace the file “mf2005.exe” under C:\MT3DMS5\Bin with the newer version, or
use the newer version by specifying the PATH of the newer executable code.
After a MODFLOW-2005 run is completed, a flow-transport link file with a name
such as p7.ftl is created which contains the flow model information required by
the transport model.
To start a MT3DMS run after the flow solution is obtained by MODFLOW-2005, enter
the command as
C:\MT3DMS5\Bin\mt3dms5b

p7mt.nam

or simply
mt3dms5b

p7mt.nam

where [mt3dms5b] is the name of the executable code for a version of MT3DMS v5
that requires the flow-transport link file to be in the style of unstructured,
true binary files that are based on a non-standard Fortran feature but are more
transportable among different Fortran compilers.

EXAMINING AND VISUALIZING MODEL RESULTS
After each MT3DMS run, some or all of the following output files are generated:
px.m3d:
mt3d001.obs:

standard text output file for test problem no. x;
optional output file with concentrations vs. total elapsed time
at user-specified observation points where 001 is species index;
mt3d001.mas: optional output file with a one-line summary of mass budgets
at each transport step or a user-specified interval;
mt3d001.ucn: optional output file with unformatted concentrations for the
dissolved phase at user-selected times;
mt3d001s.ucn: optional output file with unformatted concentrations for the
sorbed (or immobile) phase at user-selected times;
mt3d.cnf:
optional output file with model discretization data.

The PostMODFLOW|MT3DMS (PM) program distributed with MT3DMS can be used to
create concentration data files from the UCN and CNF files for use with a
graphical program such as Surfer or Tecplot. For more information, refer to the
readme file for MT3DMS utilities [Utilities.PDF].
The USGS Model Viewer software can also be used to visualize 2D or 3D
concentration distributions. MV uses the UCN and CNF files directly. A Model
Viewer configuration file named ‘conc.mv’ has been created for most test
problems. The *.mv configuration file assumes the default UCN file name
‘mt3d001.ucn’ and default CNF file name ‘mt3d.cnf’. To start MV for each test
problem, simply click on the conc.mv file name. For more information on using
Model Viewer, refer to its User’s Guide (Hsieh and Winston, 2002).
