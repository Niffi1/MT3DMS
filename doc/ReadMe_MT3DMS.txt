GENERAL INFORMATION
------------------MT3DMS is a 3-D multispecies contaminant fate and transport model
developed at the University of Alabama for the US Army Corps of
Engineers Research and Development Center. Detailed information on
MT3DMS can be found in MT3DMS Documentation and User's Guide (Zheng and
Wang, 1999) and Version 5.x Supplemental User’s Guide (Zheng, 2010),
both available at http://hydro.geo.ua.edu/mt3d.
Additional information specific to MT3DMS since version 4.0 can be found
in U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 01-82 by Zheng, Hill and
Hsieh (2001), also available at http://hydro.geo.ua.edu/mt3d.

EXECUTABLE PROGRAMS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------Two MT3DMS executables, mt3dms5s.exe and mt3dms5b.exe, are included with
the distribution files (the differences between the two are explained in
the next section). The executable programs were compiled with Lahey

FORTRAN 95 compiler (LF95) Version 5.7 to run on PCs with Pentium or
higher CPUs. MT3DMS allows dynamic memory allocation and will allocate
the exact amount of memory that is required for a particular problem at
run-time. If the memory required by the problem exceeds the total
amount of physical memory (RAM) that is available, MT3DMS will
automatically use hard-drive space as virtual memory. However, this
slows down computations dramatically. Thus, it is best to have
sufficient RAM to run any particular model. MT3DMS runs under any
recent version of Microsoft Windows in a command-prompt window.

NOTES ON THE UNFORMATTED FLOW-TRANSPORT LINK FILE
------------------------------------------------The interface between MODFLOW and MT3DMS is through a flow-transport
link file saved by the Link-MT3DMS (LMT) Package added to MODFLOW. The
flow-transport link file is usually saved as unformatted (binary
characters). (An option available in the LMT6 Package for MODFLOW-2000
and LMT7 for MODFLOW-2005 allows the link file to be saved as an ascii
text file, but the file size may be so large that the option is
generally limited to small models.) Different FORTRAN compilers or even
different versions of the same compiler may use different file
structures and styles for the unformatted binary files. For this reason,
the MT3DMS code compiled by a particular compiler may not be able to
read the unformatted flow-transport link file saved by a MODFLOW code
that was compiled with a different compiler, and vice versa.
Two versions of MT3DMS executable are included with the distribution
files. Both versions were compiled using Lahey Fortran 95 compiler
(LF95). The only difference between the two versions is in the style of
unformatted files as specified in the source include file ‘filespec.inc’.
The standard version, mt3dms5s.exe, was compiled with standard Fortran
file specifiers for the unformatted files, i.e.,
FORM=‘unformatted’ and ACCESS=‘sequential’
The resulting unformatted files are compatible with those of Visual
Fortran from HP/Compaq/Intel. However, they are not compatible with
those of earlier Lahey compilers including LF77 and LF90. Thus, an
existing flow-transport link file generated by a MODFLOW code compiled
by LF77 and LF90 needs to be regenerated for use by mt3dms5s.exe. A
utility program, LF90to95.exe, could also be used to convert the
LF77/LF90-styled unformatted file to the LF95-styled. Since MODFLOW-96
and MODFLOW-88 included with the MT3DMS distribution files were also
compiled with the same standard file specifiers, the version of MT3DMS
executable for use with MODFLOW-96 and MODFLOW-88 should be mt3dms5s.exe.
The other executable, mt3dms5b.exe, was compiled with the following file
specifiers for the unformatted files:
FORM=‘binary’ and ACCESS=‘sequential’

where FORM=‘binary’ is a non-standard Fortran feature that may or may
not be available to a specific compiler. The resulting unformatted files
are also referred to as unstructured, true binary files. An
unstructured, true binary file is not compiler specific, thus, it makes
it possible for the resulting MT3DMS code to read unformatted files that
are generated by non-Lahey compilers, as long as they are also of the
unstructured, true binary nature. The same non-standard file specifier
has been used for MODFLOW-2000 and MODFLOW-2005. Thus, the version of
MT3DMS executable for use with MODFLOW-2000 and MODFLOW-2005 should be
mt3dms5b.exe.

INSTALLATION AND RE-COMPILING
----------------------------The distribution file is a self-extracting program. Execution of the
distribution file creates numerous individual files. The extraction
program allows you to specify the directory in which the files should be
restored. The installation instructions assume that the files are
restored into directory C:\MT3DMS5. The following directory structure
will be created in C:\MT3DMS5:
|
|--MT3DMS5
|
|--bin
|
|--doc
|
|--src
|
|--examples
|
|--utility

;
;
;
;
;

compiled executables
documentation files
source code
benchmark test problems
utility programs

To make the executable programs in “\MT3DMS5\bin” accessible from any
directory, the path of the subdirectory “\MT3DMS5\bin” should be
included in the PATH environment variable. For example, you could add a
line similar to the following to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
PATH=%PATH%;C:\MT3DMS5\bin
Make sure to substitute the appropriate drive letter and pathname if not
C:\ as shown above. Reboot your system after modifying AUTOEXEC.BAT.
On Windows 2000/NT/XP systems or later, from the Start menu, find and
select Control Panel. Then edit the PATH Environment Variable to
include “C:\MT3DMS5\bin". Initiate and use a new MS-DOS Command Prompt
window after making this change.
To re-compile this version MT3DMS with Lahey LF95, copy all source files
to a temporary subdirectory and type 'AM' to start the AUTOMAKE utility.
The compiler options that should be used for recompiling are contained
in the file Automake.fig. MT3DMS was written in standard ANSI FORTRAN 77
plus some elements of FORTRAN 90, and can be compiled by most FORTRAN 77,
90 or 95 compilers with little or no modification.

RUNNING THE SOFTWARE
-------------------To run MT3DMS v5 using the Name-File method (which is the only method
since version 5), enter the command
mt3dms5s [name-file]
or
mt3dms5b [name-file]
where the command-line argument [name-file] is the name of the MT3DMS
name-file as described in Zheng (2010) and Zheng, Hill and Hsieh (2001).
If no command-line argument is given, the user is prompted to enter the
name of the name-file. If the file name ends with the extension ".nam",
it can be specified without including the extension. For example, if
the name-file is named "project.nam", the simulation can be run by
entering:
mt3dms5s project
or
mt3dms5b project

INTERFACE WITH MODFLOW-96 AND MODFLOW-88
---------------------------------------A version of the standard USGS MODFLOW-96 code implemented with the
Link-MT3D Package v5 is included with the MT3DMS distribution files.
This version of MODFLOW-96 is named mf96.exe. To activate the LMT
Package to save the flow-transport file needed by MT3DMS, insert a line
(shown in capital letters) into the MODFLOW-96 NAME file as in the
following example:
An example of MODFLOW-96 NAME file:
list 6 test1.lst
bas 1 test1.bas
bcf 11 test1.bcf
sip 13 test1.sip
oc 14 test1.oc
LMT 32 TEST1.FTL
data(binary) 93 test1.ufh
where LMT is the name of the Link-MT3D package, integer 32 is the
FORTRAN unit on which the MODFLOW-MT3D link file will be saved, and
TEST1.FTL is the name of the MODFLOW-MT3D link file containing the flow
model information needed by MT3DMS. The unit for LMT can be any
positive integer as long as it has not been used for any other files.
Any valid file name can be specified by the user for the MODFLOW-MT3D
link file. When running MT3DMS, make sure to enter the same file name,
e.g., TEST1.FTL in this example.

More information on using MODFLOW-96 with MT3DMS can be found in the
document README_MF96LMT.pdf. The source code for MODFLOW-96 with the
Link-MT3D interface can be downloaded from http://hydro.geo.ua.edu/mt3d.
A version of the standard USGS MODFLOW-88 code implemented with the
Link-MT3D Package v3 is also included with the MT3DMS distribution files.
This version of MODFLOW-88 is named mf88.exe. For more information on
using MODFLOW-88 with MT3DMS, refer to the document README_MF88LMT.pdf.
The source code for MODFLOW-88 with the Link-MT3D interface can also be
downloaded from http://hydro.geo.ua.edu/mt3d.

INTERFACE WITH MODFLOW-2000 AND MODFLOW-2005
-------------------------------------------The linkage between MT3DMS and MODFLOW-2000 is through the Link-MT3DMS
Package (LMT6) added to MODFLOW-2000 since version 1.4. The input file
for the LMT6 Package is associated with the file type "LMT6". To
activate the LMT6 Package in MODFLOW-2000, the user needs to insert a
line as shown below into the Name file of MODFLOW-2000:
#
# Link-MT3DMS input file
lmt6
66
test1.lmt
#
where "test1.lmt" is the name of the input file for the LMT6 Package
which specifies the name of the flow-transport link file and how it
should be saved by MODFLOW-2000 for use by MT3DMS. It is noteworthy
that, with MODFLOW-96, the name of the flow-transport link file is
directly specified in the NAME file of MODFLOW-96 following the “LMT”
keyword, while with MODFLOW-2000 (and MODFLOW-2005), the name of flowtransport link file is specified in an input file to the LMT6 Package.
It is the name of the LMT6 input file that follows the keyword “LMT6”.
The details of the MODFLOW-2000 and MT3DMS linkage and the input
instructions for the LMT6 Package input file are provided in Zheng, Hill
and Hsieh (2001) and also Zheng (2010).
The linkage between MT3DMS and MODLFOW-2005 is through the Link-MT3DMS
Package (LMT7) added to MODFLOW-2005 since version 1.8. The input file
for the LMT7 Package is also associated with the file type "LMT6" (note
the number 6). The method to activate the LMT package in MODFLOW-2005 is
identical to that in MODFLOW-2000 shown above.
