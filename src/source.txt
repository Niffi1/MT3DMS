
Subdirectory \standard contains the source code for MT3DMS 5.1 using 
standard FORTRAN file specifiers for unformatted files.

Subdirectory \true-binary contains the source code for MT3DMS 5.1 using 
nonstandard FORTRAN file specifiers for unstructured binary files.

The only difference between the two versions is in the include file
'filespec.inc'.
