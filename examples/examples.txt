INTRODUCTION
 
After MT3DMS is installed on the hard drive, a subdirectory named [examples] is
created which contains the input and output files for all 10 benchmark test
problems described in the MT3DMS User’s Manual (Zheng_and_Wang,_1999, p. 130-
163).  Further under [examples] are two subdirectories named [mf96mt3d] and
[mf2kmt3d], i.e.,
 
--examples
     |
     |--mf96mt3d
     |
     |--mf2kmt3d
 
The first subdirectory [mf96mt3d] contains the MT3DMS transport files along
with the flow files prepared for MODFLOW-96.  The second subdirectory
[mf2kmt3d] contains additional MT3DMS transport examples along with the flow
files prepared for MODFLOW-2000.
 
 
RUNNING MT3DMS WITH MODFLOW-96
 
To run any test problem under [mf96mt3d], first go to the subdirectory P01,
P02, …, or P10.  For each example, there are a NAME file for MODFLOW-96 called
p1mf.nam, p2mf.nam, …,or p10mf.nam, and a NAME file for MT3DMS called p1mt.nam,
p2mt.nam, …,or p10mt.nam.  These NAME files specify the input/output files
required by MODFLOW-96 and MT3DMS v5.
 
To start a MODFLOW-96 run, enter a command as follows in command prompt mode
under Microsoft Windows:
 
C:\MT3DMS5\Bin\mf96  p1mf.nam
 
where “mf96” is the name of the executable code for the version of MODFLOW-96
with Link-MT3DMS interface, and [C:\MT3DMS5\Bin] is the subdirectory where the
MT3DMS and MODFLOW executables are located.  If the subdirectory name has
already been added to the command prompt configuration file AUTOEXEC.bat or the
Windows PATH environment variable, enter the command simply as
 
mf96  p1mf.nam
 
After each MODFLOW-96 run is completed, a flow-transport link file with a name
such as p1.ftl, p1.ftl, …,or p10.ftl is created which contains the flow model
information required by the transport model.
 
To start a MT3DMS run after the flow solution is obtained by MODFLOW-96, enter
the command as
 
C:\MT3DMS5\Bin\mt3dms5s  p1mt.nam
 
or simply
 
mt3dms5s  p1mt.nam
 
where [mt3dms5s] is the name of the executable code for the standard version of
MT3DMS v5 that requires the flow-transport link file to be in the style of
structured, unformatted files generated by Lahey Fortran 95 (LF95) or Compaq/HP
Visual Fortran (VF).
 
 
RUNNING MT3DMS WITH MODFLOW-2000
 
To run any test problems under [mf2kmt3d], first go to the subdirectory for a
particular example. To start a MODFLOW-2000 run, enter a command as follows in
command prompt mode under Microsoft Windows:
 
C:\MT3DMS5\Bin\mf2k  p7mf2k.nam
 
where “mf2k” is the name of the executable code for MODFLOW-2000 version 1.15
or later with Link-MT3DMS Package 6.2 or later, and [C:\MT3DMS5\Bin] is the
subdirectory where MT3DMS and MODFLOW executables are located. If the
subdirectory name has already been added to the command prompt configuration
file AUTOEXEC.bat or the Windows PATH environment variable, enter the command
simply as
 
mf2k  p7mf2k.nam
 
Note that if a newer version of MODFLOW-2000 is installed on your PC, you can
replace the file “mf2k.exe” under C:\MT3DMS5\Bin with the newer version, or use
the newer version by specifying the PATH of the newer executable code.
 
After a MODFLOW-2000 run is completed, a flow-transport link file with a name
such as p7.ftl is created which contains the flow model information required by
the transport model. 
 
To start a MT3DMS run after the flow solution is obtained by MODFLOW-2000,
enter the command as
 
C:\MT3DMS5\Bin\mt3dms5b  p7mt.nam
 
or simply
 
mt3dms5b  p7mt.nam
 
where [mt3dms5b] is the name of the executable code for a version of MT3DMS v5
that requires the flow-transport link file to be in the style of unstructured,
true binaryfiles that are based on a non-standard Fortran feature but are more
transportable among different Fortran compilers.
 
 
EXAMINING AND VISIALIZING MODEL RESULTS
 
After each MT3DMS run, some or all of the following output files are generated:
 
px.m3d:       standard text output file for test problem no. x;
mt3d001.obs:  optional output file with concentrations vs. total elapsed time
              at user-specified observation points where 001 is species index;
mt3d001.mas:  optional output file with a one-line summary of mass budgets
              at each transport step or a user-specified interval;
mt3d001.ucn:  optional output file with unformatted concentrations for the
              dissolved phase at user-selected times;
mt3d001s.ucn: optional output file with unformatted concentrations for the
              sorbed (or immobile) phase at user-selected times;
mt3d.cnf:     optional output file with model discretization data.
 
The PostMODFLOW|MT3DMS (PM) program distributed with MT3DMS can be used to
create concentration data files from the UCN and CNF files for use with a
graphical program such as Surfer or Tecplot.  For more information, refer to
the readme file for MT3DMS utilities [Utilities.PDF].
 
The USGS Model Viewer (MV) software can also be used to visualize 2D or 3D
concentration distributions.  MV uses the UCN and CNF files directly.  A MV
configuration file named ‘conc.mv’ has been created for test problems P03 to
P10.  The MV configuration file assumes the default UCN file name ‘mt3d001.ucn’
and default CNF file name ‘mt3d.cnf’.  To start MV for each test problem,
simply click on the conc.mv file name.  For more information on using MV, refer
to MV User’s Guide (Hsieh_and_Winston,_2002).
